Baseline model: ran ridge regression 

Performance of ridge regression: ~0.4185

NN_model: minimum viable code to reproduce the neural network models. For now, I arbitrarily chose a few hyperparameters and assess their performance 
on 20% held out validation set. 

Performance of NN model: ~ 0.42+

Feedback.txt has questions for Professor Peterson and Professor Binelli

Tools.py contains code I used in my initial model developments but not important right now because I discovered skorch!!
