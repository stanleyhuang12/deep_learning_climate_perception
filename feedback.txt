A few questions and concerns: 


-- Should we keep all the variables or drop the variables?
-- Should we standardize all the features when we feed it into the neural network 
    (it significantly improves training loss)
-- Why is it that when I use a framework like Skorch that does automatic cross-validation 
(20% of the data is held out), the R squared performance on a test-set SIGNIFICANTLY drops? 


-- How many layers or neurons are we considering? A range would be helpful because I am working with limited conception
-- Is this right to treat this as a regression task and not a classification (i.e., 1, 2, 3,4, 5)?
