A few questions and concerns: 

-1) Should we keep all the county dummy variables or drop them? In my current model, I dropped them. But, we have to consider that we did not drop them for the baseline model. I can revise this fairly easily. 

-2)  Should we standardize all the features when we feed it into the neural network? 

-3) How many layers or neurons are we considering? A range would be helpful because I am working with limited conception. 

-4) Is this right to treat this as a regression task and not a classification (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)? 

-5) Any helpful resources you recommend on hyperparameter tuning?
